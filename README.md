# Race Ready Hub

**Your all-in-one race day checklist — from travel and accommodation to race rules and getting to the start line.**

## What is Race Ready Hub?

Race Ready Hub is a simple, focused checklist app for runners who want to arrive on race day calm, organized, and fully prepared.  

Whether you are racing a local 5K, a big-city marathon, or an ultra, Race Ready Hub helps you keep track of every detail so you never have that \"I forgot something\" moment again.

## Key features

- **Pre-race checklist**: Capture all the essentials — shoes, kit, nutrition, race documents, and more.
- **Travel & accommodation**: Plan where you are staying and how you will get there.
- **Race logistics**: Note bib pickup details, bag drop, start time, meeting points, and post-race meetups.
- **Course & rules**: Keep links and notes about race rules, cut-off times, elevation, and course info in one place.
- **Reusable for every race**: Reuse and adapt your checklist for future events so prep gets easier every time.

You can use it on desktop or mobile — perfect for updating your checklist while traveling or the night before your race. It does not require any login and stores your races in your browser’s local storage, so your data stays on your device and the app works offline once loaded.

## How it works (for runners)

1. **Create or select a race** you want to prepare for.
2. **Work through each section** of the checklist: travel, accommodation, race info, logistics, and gear.
3. **Mark items as done** as you book, pack, and organize your race weekend.
4. **Review everything before race day** so you can head to the start line confident and stress-free.

## Why runners love it

- **Less stress**: Everything you need to remember is in one place.
- **No more \"I forgot\" moments**: Your checklist evolves with each race, so you get better prepared over time.
- **Works for any distance**: From your first 5K to marathons and ultras.
- **Built for real race weekends**: Covers not just race gear, but also travel, accommodation, and on-the-day logistics.

## Roadmap & ideas

Some ideas we are exploring for the future:

- **Shareable checklists** with friends, clubmates, or race buddies.
